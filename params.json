{"name":"pyRouterJig","tagline":"pyRouterJig is a woodworking layout tool for creating box and dovetail joints","body":"### Welcome to pyRouterJig.\r\n\r\npyRouterJig is a woodworking layout tool for creating box and dovetail\r\njoints.  It has the following features:\r\n* Creates templates for the [Incra LS Positioner fence](http://www.incra.com/router_table_fences-ls_positiners.html).  In fact, this was the original motivation for writing pyRouterJig.\r\n* Support for both English and metric unit systems.  Currently, only English units have been tested, in part because my LS Positioner is the English version. \r\n* May be customized for any finger (box joint) or pin / tail (dovetail) spacing pattern.  Currently, two patterns are included (\"Equally spaced\" and \"Variable spaced\"), which will be described below.\r\n* pyRouterJog is licensed under the GPL, so that you're free to use and modify it.\r\n\r\n[[Installation|installation-ref]]\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRobert B.
